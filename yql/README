These files use Yahoo's new YQL to help you perform table-like queries against the OSM API. 

This is really just at proof-of-concept stage at the moment.

If you're logged into Yahoo you can add 'osm' to the list of available tables by loading 
the YQL console with the osm-api.env file. Reference the one on github using the following
link:

http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/?env=http://github.com/RandomEtc/js-vector-maps/raw/master/yql/osm-api.env

The interesting bit is when you use YQL's "execute" element to transform the data. That's 
what I'm doing in osm.geojson.xml, which references osm-yql.js. Sadly YQL round-trips js
responses through XML, and the transform process doesn't deal very well with arrays of arrays.
Consequently, I'm using the JSON.stringify function from json.org to serialize the output
of osm-yql.js and this means you can't output XML. On the other hand, this approach also
ensures that the numbers come out as numbers and not as strings.

Here's an example query to turn OSM's XML into GeoJSON:

http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/?q=select%20*%20from%20osm.geojson%20where%20bbox%3D%2211.54%2C48.14%2C11.543%2C48.145%22&env=http%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRandomEtc%2Fjs-vector-maps%2Fraw%2Fmaster%2Fyql%2Fosm-api.env

You need to use quite a small bounding box or you run into YQL's execution limits.

Otherwise, it works!
